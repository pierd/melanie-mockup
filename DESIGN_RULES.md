## Color Usage Rules

### Global Rules
1. Each service (Yoga, Massage, Midwifery) has its own dedicated color palette that should never be mixed with other service colors.
2. The Beige/Neutral and Black palettes are shared across all pages and can be used freely.
3. On the Home page only, all color palettes can be displayed together.

### Service Page Rules
1. Each service page should predominantly use its designated color palette:
   - Yoga pages use Sage Green palette
   - Massage pages use Terracotta palette
   - Midwifery pages use Golden Ochre palette

2. All service pages should incorporate:
   - Beige/Neutral palette for backgrounds, secondary elements, and hover states
   - Black palette for text, borders, and structural elements

3. Service colors should NEVER cross between pages (e.g., no Yoga green on the Massage page)

## Component Design Guidelines

### Headers
- Use the primary color of the service palette
- Include a border-bottom using the Black palette (Deep Noir)
- Use white text for contrast
- Include subtle box shadows

### Buttons
- Primary color should match the service palette
- Hover states can use Beige/Neutral palette
- Include subtle borders using the Black palette
- Use white text for contrast

### Content Sections
- Alternate between service palette colors and Beige/Neutral backgrounds
- Use the Black palette for text
- Include borders that correspond to the service palette
- Add subtle box shadows for depth

### Color Palette Showcases
- Include a dedicated section on each page showing the service's palette
- Add a note mentioning how neutral tones are incorporated
- Use a border-top with the Black palette (Deep Noir)

## Responsive Design
- All components should be fully responsive
- Use flex or grid layouts that adjust to smaller screens
- Stack elements vertically on mobile devices
- Adjust font sizes appropriately for different devices

## Typography
- Use 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif as the font family
- Maintain a clear typographic hierarchy:
  - H1: 3rem for page titles
  - H2: 2rem for section headers
  - H3: 1.5rem for subsections
  - Body: 1rem with 1.6 line height

## Accessibility Guidelines
- Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and backgrounds
- Use appropriate text sizes for readability
- Include hover/focus states for interactive elements
- Use semantic HTML elements

This design system ensures a cohesive look while maintaining distinct identities for each service area.
